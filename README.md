# Retail Sales Forecasting with Prophet

A comprehensive time series forecasting project using the Prophet algorithm to predict weekly retail sales, incorporating external economic and environmental factors for enhanced accuracy.

## Project Overview

This project tackles a critical business challenge in retail: **sales forecasting**. Using historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores spanning 2010-2012, I built a machine learning model that predicts future sales while accounting for seasonal patterns, holidays, and external economic factors.

**Key Achievement**: Developed a forecasting model with **4.76% MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), exceeding industry accuracy standards for retail forecasting.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Walmart Store Sales Data
- **Size**: 6,435 records across 45 stores
- **Time Period**: 2010-2012 (143 weeks)
- **Features**: 
  - Weekly sales figures
  - Store identifiers
  - Date information
  - Holiday flags
  - Economic indicators (unemployment rate, CPI, fuel prices)
  - Environmental data (temperature)

## Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **Prophet** - Facebook's time series forecasting tool
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Model evaluation metrics
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing

## Key Features

### Advanced Forecasting Capabilities
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Automatically detects and models yearly seasonality
- **Holiday Effects**: Incorporates special events that impact sales patterns  
- **External Regressors**: Leverages economic indicators for improved accuracy
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence intervals for risk assessment

### Model Performance
- **MAPE**: 4.76% (Excellent - industry benchmark is <5%)
- **Trend Capture**: Successfully models both seasonal spikes and baseline trends
- **Holiday Accuracy**: Precisely predicts 35-40% sales increases during peak seasons

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights

### Business Impact
- **52-Week Forecast**: Generated comprehensive sales projections for strategic planning
- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Identified optimal inventory and staffing periods
- **Economic Sensitivity**: Quantified impact of external factors on sales performance
- **Risk Assessment**: Provided confidence intervals for scenario planning

### Key Findings
1. **Strong Seasonality**: Holiday periods drive 35-40% sales increases
2. **Economic Correlation**: Sales respond significantly to unemployment and fuel prices
3. **Trend Analysis**: Baseline sales show gradual decline requiring strategic intervention
4. **Forecasting Accuracy**: Model consistently outperforms simple seasonal baselines


## Sample Output
